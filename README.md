This guide allows you to add live location tracking to an Android app. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) is the recommended development environment for building an app with the MapmyIndia InTouch SDK for Android.
#### Step 1. Download the InTouchDemo App.
[Click here](https://github.com/MapmyIndia/mapmyindia-intouch-android-sdk/archive/master.zip) to download the InTouchDemo App Project. Open this project in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

#### Step 2. Set your Publishable key

1.  Add the publishable key to  [SetUpKeyFragment Fragment](https://github.com/MapmyIndia/mapmyindia-intouch-android-sdk)  file.
    
2.  Run project on your device using simulator instance.
    
3.  Go through run-time [permission flow](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting) (applicable for Android M and later).

#### Step 3. Check your location on the InTouch [dashboard](https://intouch.mapmyindia.com/nextgen)

			  //write your code here                      
	}
	@Override
	public void onError(String reason, String identifier, String description) {
	         // reason gives the error type. 
            // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
           // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.
	}
});

~~~
####  Kotlin
```Kotlin
InTouch.initialize(<device name>, <your client id>, <your client secret>, object : IAuthListener {  
    override fun onSuccess() {  
         //write your code here 
    }  
	override fun onError(reason: String?, errorIdentifier: String?, errorDescription: String?) {  
       // reason gives the error type. 
      // errorIdentifier gives information about error code. 
      // errorDescription gives a message for a particular error.
